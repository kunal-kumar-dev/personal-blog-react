      <p>
        Hi, I am <b>Kunal Kumar</b>, a Computer Science & Engineering student.
        This blog project is developed as part of my academic coursework
        to practice ReactJS concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this project, I learned component-based architecture,
        client-side routing, state management using hooks, and CRUD
        operations using localStorage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main goal of this project is learning and implementation,
        not commercial use.
      </p>
